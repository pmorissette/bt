    Flow control Algo.

    This algo returns the value of a predicate
    on an temp entry. Useful for controlling
    flow.

    For example, we might want to make sure we have some items selected.
    We could pass a lambda function that checks the len of 'selected':

        pred=lambda x: len(x) == 0
        item='selected'

    Args:
        * pred (Algo): Function that returns a Bool given the strategy. This
            is the definition of an Algo. However, this is typically used
            with a simple lambda function.
        * item (str): An item within temp.
        * if_none (bool): Result if the item required is not in temp or if it's
            value if None
